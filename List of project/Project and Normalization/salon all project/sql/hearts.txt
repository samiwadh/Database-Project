		intreduction heats
heart is an exordinay machine it's work to pumping blood though body 
		chambers
heat has four chamber 
2 upper chamber
left atrium and right atrium 
right ventricle and left ventricle 
when a heart beat is normal blood and teasue flow toward atriua then ventricle
inside of heart there are septum
there are two kind of Septum there work is to mixing blood 
1) interatial septurn 
2) interventricular septum


two valves 
1) tricuspid valves :- opened right ventricle
2)bicuspid valve is also know as mitral valve :- opened left ventricle
there are in middle of atrima and ventricle valves prevind blood backward to atrima 
=strong thin tessuse called chordae tendinease
 blood leaving the ventricle pass throgh another valves pulmonary valves
between our right ventricle and pulmonary trunk 
and our aortic valve conncting left ventricle and aortic 

making our blood more effication myocardium is a rage in a unique pattern 
there are three lears in myocardim which rape around our heart which tight and 
ripping to push our blood 

vondi

peace maker cells 
genate electial signal to our heart 
and the heart musels cells call myocytes contrate as a grop 

CIRULATION 
our heart divided in two part one is right half and 2nd is left half 
right side of heart dioxgent blood and body tressue pass trough large vanse 
 called superior vena cava and inferior vena cava into rght atrium 
the blood move into right ventricle which contacs and sense blood out of 
heart through our lungs

the left side oxigen rigd blood from lung through our promary wans to left '
artima thorugh left ventricale, which can contans blood out of hearts through 
the aorta to feed tessuse

the  first braches of our autia  cornary artery  which supplie oxgen and nituran  
top of autia to care blood to head and upper limbs
and middle and lower autia supplie blood abdonmen and lower limbs

60-100 beats per min heat pump 5 quarts per min throgh our autia
